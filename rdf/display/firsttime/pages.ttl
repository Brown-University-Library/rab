<h3>Biology and Public Health Faculty: see an <a href=\"http://www.screencast.com/users/bellis_lib/folders/Camtasia/media/92364717-9357-44a2-a082-7e47d3c003d1/embed\" target=\"_blank\">instructional screencast</a></h3>
<hr />
<p>
Currently, your publications show up in the \"Scholarly Work\" section of your profile as a block of plain text.  In a new \"Publications\" section it is now possible to have a clickable list of titles with links to full text when available.  ALL FACULTY can enter publications into a form that captures title, journal, and other citation metadata as separate fields. If you know the DOI or PMID for an article simply enter that identifier and Researchers@Brown will pull in all associated metadata. For any article with a DOI we will provide a link to the online text (if available).
</p>
<p>
Publications for Biology and Public Health faculty have been harvested from PubMed for approval in the Profile Manager.  Initially publications were harvested for faculty for whom a CV was provided.  If you have no pending publications but wish to have publications harvested in the future:

<ul style=\"list-style:disc;margin-left:25px\">
<li>Add at least one article by entering a PMID in the \"Add publication by DOI or PMID\" section</li>
<li>Your publications will be included in the next harvest</li>
<li>Harvesting is done every Sunday night</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Harvesting from other sources (Web of Science, etc.) and for other faculty and disciplines will be available in the future.  Publications entered through the form or by entering a DOI/PMID are automatically \"approved\".  At this time only Biology and Public Health faculty will see \"pending\" publications needing approval.
</p>


<a name=\"begin\"></a><h3><strong>Begin Managing Your Publications</strong></h3>
<p>
<ul style=\"list-style:disc;margin-left:25px\">
<li>Click the “Manage Your Profile” link in the upper right hand corner of each page on the <a href=\"http://vivo.brown.edu\">Researchers@Brown website</a>.</li>
<li>Log in using your Brown credentials. This will take you to the Profile Manager. On the left hand side of the page, you will see a sidebar of the editable areas of your profile. Click the “Publications” link.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<a name=\"verify\"></a><h3><strong>Verifying Your Publications</strong> (Biology & Public Health Faculty)</h3>
<p>Starting with a few publications from your CV, we were able to query PubMed for other publications authored by you.  Once you approve these publications they will be searchable in Researchers@Brown by title, journal title, co-authors, and other citation elements. You have two options for verifying your publications: all at once or individually.
<ul style=\"list-style:disc;margin-left:25px\">
<li>Under “Publications” click the first button, “Manage publications.” This section is organized into “Pending publications” and “Approved publications”. Please take a moment to look through your pending publications. Note that under each title, there are two buttons: “Approve” and “This isn't my publication.”</li>

<li>If all the publications listed are correct, you can click the “Approve all pending publications” button on the right side of the “Pending publications” heading. The service will ask you to confirm that you want to approve all your pending publications. The process of approving all your publications can take up to about a minute depending on how many publications have to be approved.  [You can always edit or delete publications at a later time if you notice errors.]</li>
<li>You can also approve or reject each publication individually using the buttons under each title.
<ul style=\"list-style:circle;margin-left:25px\">
<li>If you click “Approve,” the color of the title will switch from black to gray and the status will switch from “Pending” to “Approved”. The title will now show up in your public list of publications. If you wish to cancel this action, click “Cancel”; this will return the title's status to “Pending. “</li>
<li>If you are sure that a title is not yours, click “This isn't my publication.” This will also change the color of the title from black to gray and the status will switch from “Pending” to “Declined.” You can also cancel this action by clicking the cancel button, which will return the title to “Pending” status.
</li>
<li>Once you have finished verifying pending publications, they will show up in the approved publications section of the Manager next time you sign in. You can also see a public view of all your publications by clicking \"Public list of publications\", which will take you to the “Publications” section of your faculty profile.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</p>

<a name=\"edit\"></a><h3><strong>Editing Publications</strong></h3>
<p>
<ul style=\"list-style:disc;margin-left:25px\">
<li>Publications which have been harvested and approved or entered manually by citation or DOI/PMID appear as \"Approved Publications.\" You can edit or delete each of these individually using the buttons under the titles. </li>
<li>The edit button takes you to the publication editor where you can change the citation information by individual field.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<a name=\"new\"></a><h3><strong>Adding New Publications</strong></h3>
<p>
<ul style=\"list-style:disc;margin-left:25px\">
<li>If you want to add structured publications or your harvested list of publications is incomplete, you can add a new publication in the profile editor by navigating to the “Publications” section. You can add a publication manually using the publication editor or by simply entering a DOI or PMID. </li>
<li>If you click “Add publication,” you will be asked to manually input all the citation information. </li>
<li>If you click “Add a publication by DOI or PMID,” you will be asked for the DOI or PMID. (The website does the rest.)</li>
<li>Once you have entered the correct information, click “Submit.” </li>

<p>Researchers@Brown brings together, in one site, publicly available
information on the people, departments, and activities that collectively make up research and scholarship
in all disciplines at Brown. Researchers@Brown is an implementation of <a href=\"https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/VIVO/VIVO+Main+Page\">VIVO</a>, an open-source, linked open data, research networking tool developed at Cornell University and currently in use at a growing number of institutions worldwide.</p>
<p>
All information in the initial release of Researchers@Brown comes from
institutional sources (Workday, FIS, Banner) and from faculty profiles in the Directory of Research
and Researchers at Brown (DRR-B). As the infrastructure of the DRR-B is outdated
and no longer sustainable,
Researchers@Brown provides a more functional and sustainable environment than the DRR-B.  An external
interface for managing Researchers@Brown profiles has been built to
avoid the inflexibilities and difficulties of use found in the native VIVO editor.</p>
<p>DRR-B profiles have been automatically redirected to the new Researchers@Brown profiles.
</p>
<p>

<hr />

<a name=\"implementation\"></a><h3>Implementation Plan</h3>
<p>
To ensure as smooth a transition as possible from the DRR-B, Reseachers@Brown has been rolled
out in phases. With each phase, training and support are available to faculty and their deputies. All faculty are encouraged to use the new system to its full potential.
</p>
<ul style=\"list-style:disc;margin-left:25px;\">
<li> <span style=\"color:black\">Phase 1 (November 2013 - April 2014): Migration of DRR-B Data and User Testing</span><br />

Data from DRR-B profiles was migrated to Researchers@Brown by March 1, 2014. In addition to the
information carried over from the DRR-B, these new profiles include
teaching information from Banner and name, title, department, degree, and contact information from
the Faculty Information System (FIS). An attached PDF file of the faculty
member’s CV (from the DRR-B) was included as well.
<br /><br />

In December, 2013 and January 2014, we conducted extensive testing of Researchers@Brown with participation by 57 faculty members across 44 academic departments, receiving overall positive feedback from those who reviewed their data and tested the functionality of R@B.  While faculty offered a number of good suggestions for future enhancements, most indicated that it is a clear improvement over DRR-B and significantly better than the earlier implementation of VIVO.<br /><br />

During a soft launch in March and April 2014, faculty were able to review and edit their new profiles while their DRR-B profiles remained visible but not editable.  On May 1, 2014, Researchers@Brown went live, the DRR-B was decommissioned, and DRR-B profiles were automatically
redirected to the new Researchers@Brown profiles. <br /><br />

The information displayed in the newly-created public profiles is read-only.
Faculty and their deputies edit profiles in an external, user-friendly interface by clicking \"Manage your profile\" on the top right of every page. <br /><br /></li>

<li><span style=\"color:black\">Phase 2 (May - July 2014): Structured Publication Data</span><br />
A user-friendly editor for publications was launched on July 1, 2014 in conjunction with harvesting of publications for Biology and Public Health.  This editor allows all faculty to easily add and edit structured publication data by entering a citation or simply a DOI or PubMed ID.  This publications data will include links to <a href=\"http://vivo.brown.edu/themes/brown/images/full_text2.htm\">full text</a> if a DOI is available.<br /><br />

For Biology and Public Health faculty, publication data from vendor-parsed CVs was used to seed harvesting of additional publications using Harvard's Catalyst API.    Structured publication data
is intended to replace plain text citations in the \"Scholarly Work\" section of Researchers@Brown.<br /><br />
</li>

<li><span style=\"color:black\">Phase 3 (Summer - October 2014): Hospital-based Faculty Data and and Governance Structure</span><br />
Select publication data from vendor-parsed CVs will be loaded into profiles for hospital-based faculty. Publication data from vendor-parsed CVs will be used to seed harvesting of additional publications using Harvard's Catalyst API.  <br /><br />

Plans will be developed for harvesting from sources other than PubMed (Web of Science, etc) and on behalf of other faculty groups and disciplines.<br /><br />

A governance structure will be established to set policies and priorities for the maintenance and further development of Researchers@Brown.
<br /><br /></li>

<!--
<li><span style=\"color:black\">Phase 3 (Spring 2014)</span><br />
Work will continue to refine and improve the search and discovery capabilities of R@B, to add features such as the ability to output data as the basis for an NIH Biosketch, and to improve the site’s visual presentation. Going forward, working groups will consult with faculty to set priorities for inclusion of additional data and features to Researchers@Brown.
<br /><br /></li>
-->
</ul>


<a name=\"who\"></a><h3>Who is included in Researchers@Brown?</h3>
<p>
Faculty affairs offices in the Dean of the Faculty, the Division of Biology and Medicine, and the School of Public Health have
created a set of simple rules for inclusion in Researchers@Brown. While the rules will determine the automated creation of

<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/brown.edu/forms/d/1H_LzEHRzpxv3OY266RjSwpAMwVuTEUFyNEgMPcZ4NiA/viewform\">Make a suggestion!</a></p>

<p>
The implementation of Researchers@Brown has been overseen by a core team composed of representatives from the Dean of the Faculty,
Division of Biology, School of Public Health, Office of the Vice President for Research, Provost's Office, Computing and Information Services, and the Library.
Having launched on May 1, 2014, Researchers@Brown is now in a transitional stage.  A new oversight structure to set
policies and development priorities is under discussion. The roadmap below is therefore tentative.
</p>

<hr />

<h3>Improvements and New Features Since Launch</h3>
<ul style=\"list-style:disc;margin-left:25px;\">
<li><span style=\"color:black\">Structured Publication Data</span><br/>

            <p>A new <a href=\"/publications\">\"Publications\"</a> section is now available.  Features include:
            <ul style=\"list-style:circle;margin-left:50px;\">
                <li>Enter DOI or PMID to have full citation automatically retrieved</li>
                <li>Links to full text when available</li>
                <li>Easy form for entering/editing publications as separate fields</li>
                <li>Harvested publications from PubMed for Biology and Public Health faculty</li>
            </ul>
    </p>
</li>
<li><span style=\"color:black\">Geographic Research Areas</span><br/>
You may now add geographic research areas using a standard set of geographic terms.  This section in under \"Research\" in the Profile Manager.  Type 3 characters to pull up a list of terms from which to choose.<br /><br />
</li>
</ul>
<hr />

<h3>Planned and Potential Future Improvements and New Features</h3>

<ul style=\"list-style:disc;margin-left:25px;\">

<li><span style=\"color:black\">Expanded Harvesting of Publications</span><br/>
In the future we will harvest publications from other sources (Web of Science, arXiv, etc.) and for additional faculty groups and disciplines.
<br /><br /></li>

<li><span style=\"color:black\">Software Upgrades</span><br/>
Upgrade to <a href=\"http://duraspace.org/node/2175\">VIVO 1.7</a>
<br /><br /></li>

<li><span style=\"color:black\">Additional and Improved Structured Data</span><br />
Grant data is currently plain text migrated from the DRR-B.  Coeus and government sources will be used in the future to automate (when possible) the capture of grant data. <br /><br />

Other data types -- service, presentations, artistic works, awards and honors, etc will be considered and prioritized by the oversight group for conversion to structured data.<br /><br />

Improvements are planned in the Research Areas section:  Use of subject vocabularies, normalization of entries, and user guidelines. This will provide a more robust search.<br /><br />
Normalization of the names of external organizations and the addition of links as appropriate are in the planning stage.<br /><br />
</li>

<li><span style=\"color:black\">Non-Brown Collaborators</span><br/>
The ability to add non-Brown collarborators and non-faculty Brown collarborators is a future improvement.<br /><br /> </li>

<li><span style=\"color:black\">Integration with Other Systems</span><br/>
Researchers@Brown will use <a href=\"http://orcid.org\">ORCID</a> identifiers when that system is rolled out to the campus.<br /><br />

The future integration of Researchers@Brown with the <a href=\"https://repository.library.brown.edu/\">Brown Digital Repository (BDR)</a> is highly desirable. A faculty member might deposit a publication in the BDR and have the citation and link automatically available in Researchers@Brown.
<br /><br /></li>

A widget that would allow you to add Researchers@Brown data to your website has been developed for Duke University's VIVO instance and may be customized in the future for Brown use. <br /><br />

<li><span style=\"color:black\">Output to NIH Biosketch</span><br/>
The University of Florida has developed a tool for creating NIH Biosketch documents in RTF using SPARQL and Python.  See: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA77759ESzE&feature=youtu.be\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA77759ESzE&feature=youtu.be</a>
As additional structured data becomes available in Researchers@Brown, the capacity to output to CV other formats will become more feasible.</li>
<br/><br/>
</ul>

<li>maybe you can send us a link suggesting we update once a year, so that we can go to it right out of our email.</li>
<li>Under Education and Training, LINK each name of university or college to that school's homepage</li>
<li>Need controlled vocabularies for field, interest search</li>
<li>Automatic updates from NIH Reporter for funded grants, updates from PubMed (planned for Phase 2 – see above)</li>
