vitro-template
===========

This repo is a template for building [Vitro](https://github.com/vivo-project/Vitro/) projects.  Vitro is useful as an adminstrative interface to a triple store. 

Some things I hope to do with this.  

 * develop/extend ontologies
 * build a custom Solr index for a triple store
 * deploy Vitro with Jetty instead of Tomcat
 * learn more about the [VIVO](https://github.com/vivo-project/VIVO) and [Vitro](https://github.com/vivo-project/Vitro) codebases
